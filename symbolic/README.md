# Symbolic Control Synthesis

A Python implementation of **Symbolic Control** for nonlinear dynamical systems. This project provides tools for abstracting continuous systems into finite-state models and synthesizing controllers that are **correct by construction**.

## 🎯 Overview

Traditional control methods often struggle with complex specifications (safety constraints, temporal logic) and nonlinear dynamics. **Symbolic Control** addresses this by:

1. **Abstracting** a continuous system into a discrete (finite) model
2. **Synthesizing** a controller on the discrete model
3. **Concretizing** the controller back to the physical system

This approach provides **formal guarantees** of correctness and handles rich specifications like safety, reachability, and temporal logic.

- **Synthesis Capabilities:**
  - Safety synthesis (invariance)
  - Reachability synthesis
  - Combined safety + reachability
  - Regular language specifications via NFA/Regex

- **Interactive GUI:**

## 📖 Usage

### GUI Workflow

1. **Select Dynamics Model**: Choose between Integrator, Unicycle, or Manipulator
2. **Configure Parameters**:
   - State bounds (workspace limits)
   - Discretization η (grid cell size)
   - Control discretization
   - Sampling period τ
3. **Define Regions**:
   - Draw obstacles (red regions to avoid)
   - Draw target region (green region to reach)
4. **Run Synthesis**: Click "Run Synthesis" to compute the controller
5. **Simulate**: Click on the grid to set a start position and run simulation

### Programmatic Usage

```python
from symbolic_control import (
    IntegratorDynamics, 
    Abstraction, 
    Synthesis
)
import numpy as np

# 1. Create dynamics
dynamics = IntegratorDynamics(
    tau=0.4,           # Sampling period
    w_bound=0.01,      # Disturbance bound
    u_values=np.linspace(-1, 1, 5)
)

# 2. Create abstraction
state_bounds = np.array([[0, 10], [0, 10]])  # 2D workspace
abstraction = Abstraction(
    dynamics=dynamics,
    state_bounds=state_bounds,
    eta=0.5  # Grid cell size
)

# 3. Compute transitions
abstraction.compute_transitions()

# 4. Define regions and run synthesis
# ... (see examples in gui_simple.py)
```

## 🧮 Theory

The symbolic control methodology consists of three steps:

### 1. Symbolic Abstraction (Continuous → Discrete)
- Partition state space into a uniform grid
- Compute transitions using over-approximation (Post operator)
- Each grid cell becomes a symbolic state

### 2. Controller Synthesis (Discrete Domain)
- **Safety**: Find maximal controlled invariant set
- **Reachability**: Compute winning set via backward iteration
- **Complex Specs**: Use product automaton with NFA

### 3. Concretization (Discrete → Continuous)
- Map symbolic controller back to continuous system
- Acts as a lookup table: state → cell → control
